TimberTreeUtils
===============

Set of [timber](https://github.com/JakeWharton/timber) trees for
[Crashlytics](https://fabric.io/kits/android/crashlytics) and debugging.


Usage
----

This library only contains `Timber.Tree` implementations. Just plant it to Timber.

```java
Timber.plant(new CrashlyticsLogExceptionTree())
```


Trees
----

### CrashlyticsLogExceptionTree (Default log level: ERROR)

Sends non-fatal exception to Crashlytics with `Crashlytics.logException()`.

If no throwable is passed, it generates stack trace from caller of Timber.e() or etc.
NOTE: Stack trace elements of timber code are automatically removed before sent.

### CrashlyticsLogTree (Default log level: WARN)

Records log to Crashlytics with `Crashlytics.log()`.

Recorded logs will be shown in each Crashes/Non-Fatals report.

### ThrowErrorTree (Default log level: ERROR)

Throws LogPriorityExceededError (extends Error) if log level exceeds specified level.

Useful when dogfooding, debugging, quality assurance. DON'T plant() this on production environment.


Filtering logs
----

### Specifying minimum log level

```java
CrashlyticsLogTree tree = new CrashlyticsLogTree(Log.INFO);
```

### Excluding log by custom logic

```java
ThrowErrorTree tree = new ThrowErrorTree(Log.ERROR, new LogExclusionStrategy() {
    @Override
    public boolean shouldSkipLog(int priority, String tag, String message, Throwable t) {
        return message.startsWith("NO_FAIL_FAST");
    }
});
```
